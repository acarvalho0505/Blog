#Hello!

Cape Town, a place teaming with adventure, culture, and the avid pick-pockers on long street. This is a quick intro into my summer and some things I have been working on!

#Logistics

I will be living in the beautiful Camps Bay. Our housing is situated right on the beach and with an epic right handed beach break down the road called, Glen's Beach.
